Helpful lodash I've used

_.filter - works just like regular filter, used to be more performant
_.indexOf - same as regular
_.pluck - takes a property we give it and "plucks" it out of (now its merged into .map)
_.any -
_.union - has to be passed each array so use the spread operator ... (merges arrays together)
_.chain - lets lodash know that we want to do multiple functions. can be structured to create a function of         chained functions
